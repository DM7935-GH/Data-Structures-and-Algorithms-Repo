## About This Repository

The purpose of this repo is simply to practice creating common data structures and algorithms, refreshing my knowledge of Java in the process. The implementation of these is likely to differ from their built-in counterparts.

### Folder Structure

- `lib`: Holds the JAR files needed for JUnit.
- `src/mainPackage`: Holds the source code for the data structures and algorithms.
- `bin`: Holds the class files compiled from the source code.
-  `TestFolder`: Holds the JUnit test files and the main executable used for manual testing.

#### Data Structures (as of 30/08/25):

- Basic List (`BasicList.java`)
- Stack (`BasicStack.java`)
- Circular Queue (`CircularQueue.java`)
- Linked List (`LinkedList.java`)
- Circular Linked List (`CircularLinkedList.java`)
- Multilist (`CountryLinkedList.java`)
- Hash Table (`HashTable_SC.java` for seperate chaining & `HashTable_OA.java` for open addressing)
- Tree (`Tree.java`)

#### Sorting Algorithms (found in `SortingAlgorithms.java`)

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quicksort
- Merge Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
